## LAST.FM 

#### It is an application that you can access the 'Top Artists' and their 'Top Albums' and 'Top Tracks' with the detail. I used the same component for Albums and Tracks card component. The information is taken from the Last.fm API.


```bash
🎼 User can see the list of top artists at the main page.
🎙️ User can see the detail of a specific artist.
🌓 User can switch to dark mode and vice-versa.
```
